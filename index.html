Throughout his life, he encouraged people to turn inward and seek the source of their consciousness. His teachings continue to inspire spiritual seekers around the world.</p>

    <h2>Teachings of Ramana Maharshi</h2>
    <p>Ramana Maharshi's teachings primarily focus on the practice of self-inquiry, which he referred to as "Atma Vichara". He taught that by repeatedly asking oneself "Who am I?", one could realize their true self, which is the absolute consciousness beyond the ego and physical body.</p>
    <p>He emphasized the importance of self-realization and the understanding that the self is the ultimate reality. According to him, the mind is the source of all suffering, and by turning inward, one can dissolve the mind and experience true peace and bliss.</p>
    <p>Ramana Maharshi also taught the concept of non-duality (Advaita), which asserts that there is no separation between the individual self and the absolute. He believed that everything in the universe is interconnected and that realizing this unity is the key to liberation.</p>
    <p>His teaching of self-inquiry is not just a meditation technique but a way of living. By staying in the presence of the "I", the true self, one begins to dissolve the false sense of individuality and recognize the oneness of existence.</p>
